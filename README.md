FunButtonsVersion1
==================

This is a code test that was thrown at me at the very end of an mobile engineering interview at ESPN and I threw this demo app together within 20 minutes.  

Yes, this first version does use UIButtons and I forgot to remove the status bar, but I was pretty proud for banging this out pretty quickly.

Here are the requirements as they were listed on the sheet of paper in front of me:

## iOS Survey

Requirements:

- Develop a universal iOS app with no status bar with the name "Button Fun"
- Fill the screen with 40 px x 40 px random colored squares laid out in a grid.
- When the user presses a square, change the color of the square to a new one.

Bonus points, try not to use UIButtons.
